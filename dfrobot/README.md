Laurence's [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RAleg7ZHxuUZmmoM4lozdfwikm91hurRqoSRQPs-0vs/edit#gid=290336845) with list of sensors.

### General installations
```
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install python-pip
mkdir /opt/arduino-cli; cd /opt/arduino-cli/
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh | sh
export PATH=/opt/arduino-cli/bin:$PATH
cd /opt/fu_sensors/dfrobot/beep
arduino-cli config init
arduino-cli core update-index
# arduino-cli board list
arduino-cli core install  arduino:avr
arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:leonardo beeo
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyACM0 --fqbn arduino:avr:leonardo  beep

# For SEN0137 Temperature and Humidity sensor
arduino-cli lib install "DHT sensor library for ESPx"

# For DFR0198: Waterproof DS18B20 Sensor Kit
arduino-cli lib install OneWire

sudo python3 -m pip install influxdb-client

```

The scripts pyserial-miniterm and pyserial-ports are installed in '/home/pi/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.

## Notes
Couldn't connect to the Arduino from the Raspberry Pi (via terminal from OSX) to do the pH and EC calibration due to what appear to be problems with how the terminal input is handled. Therefore copies of the relevant repositories were made and the code updated to work with an updated protocol:
* https://github.com/linucks/DFRobot_EC
* https://github.com/linucks/DFRobot_PH

Need to isolate the pH and EC probes if using in the same solution. A solution is:

For long-term use of pH probe, need to use industrial version of the pH probe:
* https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1110.html
* https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1074.html

For EC probe also need an industrial version. [Michael Ratcliffe](http://www.michaelratcliffe.com/) has a simple suggestion
* https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/49895/how-to-measure-electrical-conductivity-using-arduino

The specifications of the current probe are:
* Supply Voltage: 3.0~5.0V
* Output Voltage: 0~3.4V
* Probe Connector: BNC
* Signal Connector: PH2.0-3Pin
* Measurement Accuracy: Â±5% F.S.
* K = 1.0
